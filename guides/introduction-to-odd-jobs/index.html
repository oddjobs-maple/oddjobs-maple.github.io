The player must decide what job advancements to take, how to allocate their AP, how to allocate their SP, and what equipment to use in combat. The player is free to do as they wish, so long as they don‚Äôt violate any of the game‚Äôs rules. Nevertheless, the game naturally encourages players to make their choices in one of a handful of narrow ways.</p><p>In spite of the game‚Äôs encouragement, players of MapleStory have always found creative and interesting ways to violate these norms. In many cases, these violations have their own kind of structure ‚Äî a certain logic to them. So much so, that we often think of these strange character builds as ‚Äújobs‚Äù in their own right. These so-called ‚Äúodd jobs‚Äù are the subject of this brief introductory guide.</p><p>This guide gives a brief overview of some of the most essential and commonly-played odd jobs. For a more detailed list, you can check out <a href="https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html">the list of odd jobs on the <strong>Oddjobs</strong> website</a>. This guide also doesn‚Äôt cover any odd jobs that are unique to post-Big-Bang MapleStory.</p><details>

As a result, they are necessarily permabeginners, and they have a very limited set of monsters that they can fight. DEX is perhaps the most important stat for islanders, as it improves their minimum damage per hit, thus bringing them closer to one-shotting the monsters of Maple Island.</p><p>Because Maple Island is totally isolated from the rest of the Maple World, islanders have a very unique set of equipment &amp; scrolls that they can use. As a result, events are more important to islanders than they are to other characters, because they offer the chance to obtain special items that don‚Äôt occur naturally.</p><p>Although they may appear severely limited at first glance, dedicated islanders are capable of achieving impressive levels. They also come in many flavours!:</p><a href="#subspecies" class="h-anchor"><h4 id="subspecies">Subspecies</h4></a><a href="#introduction-to-odd-jobs" class="go-back"

Outland permabeginners have a whole Maple World to explore, but their arsenal remains much the same as their inland counterparts: pretty much just basic-attacking.</p><p>Because they have access to more dangerous terrain, outland permabeginners care more about their <em>average</em> damage per hit than inland permabeginners do, and can reach greater heights! But with the dangerous terrain, comes the realisation that beginners are strong at heart, but maybe not in body. Permabeginners have exceptionally poor MAXHP (although they benefit more from WDEF than other classes do), and basic-attacking eventually becomes too weak to competently fight monsters of the permabeginner‚Äôs own level.</p><p>That being said, outland permabeginners are a perennially popular choice of main character for the odd-minded! Most focus on STR (sometimes with DEX added, to improve WACC), and tend to use polearms, swords, and daggers. Nevertheless, outland permabeginners are at least as diverse as their inland counterparts.</p><p>Depending on the version of MapleStory, outland permabeginners may have access to special beginner-only weapons, like the level 20 Frozen Tuna, the Sake Bottle, and the almighty Maroon Mop.</p><a href="#subspecies" class="h-anchor"><h4 id="subspecies">Subspecies</h4></a><a href="#introduction-to-odd-jobs" class="go-back"

Permawarriors take first job advancement to warrior/sword(wo)man, but never job advance beyond this point. This makes perma-firsts similar to permabeginners, in that they are defined by their refusal to job advance.</p><p>Permawarriors rely on Power Strike &amp; Slash Blast for offence, and Improved MaxHP Increase &amp; Iron Body for defence. This makes them quite versatile, although they are sluggish due to a lack of mobility skills and ranged attacks.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable aspect of the permawarrior is the sheer variety of equipment that they are capable of using. Not only do they get full access to warrior-only equipment like ordinary warriors do, but they are also much less picky when it comes to weapon types. Polearms, swords, axes, blunt weapons, and even daggers are all very viable weapons for the permawarrior!</p><a href="#hp-warrior" class="h-anchor"><h3 id="hp-warrior">HP warrior</h3></a><a href="#introduction-to-odd-jobs" class="go-back"

An HP warrior only adds enough STR to job advance, and then waits until they have Improved MaxHP Increase maxed before dumping all of their AP into MAXHP. This makes HP warriors <em>incredibly</em> durable ‚Äî they may hit the 30k MAXHP cap at around level 90‚Äì100!</p><p>The main tool in the HP warrior‚Äôs arsenal is typically Power Guard. Every time that the HP warrior touches a foe, a portion of the damage that they take is removed from their foe‚Äôs HP. This is often inefficient, but means that HP warriors can fight just about <em>any</em> enemy by the time that they are level ‚âà41 or so! It also means that HP warriors typically go the fighter or page route for second job advancement (spear(wo)men never get Power Guard). To maximise their Power Guard damage, the HP warrior seeks to lower their WDEF as much as possible ‚Äî to that end, the debuff from Rage can be useful (in addition to being useful for the party).</p><p>Rarely, HP warriors may go the spear(wo)man route in order to provide support for their party while still at a low level, in the form of Hyper Body and Iron Will.</p><details>

They‚Äôre exclusive to thieves <em>and</em> warriors! Because these thief-warrior daggers <em>only</em> require STR and DEX to be equipped (i.e. no LUK required), they naturally encourage the creation of dagger warriors.</p><p>Like permawarriors, dagger warriors are essentially stuck with Power Strike &amp; Slash Blast for life. However, unlike permawarriors, dagger warriors can take second job (and further job) advancements. This unlocks tons of useful goodies. Most notably: Rage, Threaten, Hyper Body, Berserk, Shout, Shield Mastery, and most of all, Combo Attack!

Although DEX warriors deal considerably less damage than their non-odd counterparts, they are typically capable of using the same skillset, and their extreme agility comes with its own perks.</p><p>DEX warriors are renowned for their godlike accuracy and incredibly stable damage output. They also have much more avoidability than STR-based warriors, and have no issues wielding the legendary Stonetooth Sword. And DEX <em>does</em> contribute to the magnitude of the warrior‚Äôs damage ‚Äî this, combined with the arsenals provided by the various warrior classes, makes DEX warriors some of the most high-powered odd jobs overall.</p><p>Because of their STRlessness, DEX warriors have unique equipment considerations. This often results in DEX warrior gear looking more like permabeginner gear than ordinary warrior gear.</p><a href="#related-species" class="h-anchor"><h4 id="related-species">Related species</h4></a><a href="#introduction-to-odd-jobs" class="go-back"

One way to think about magelets is that STR mages are to STRginners, as magelets are to LUKginners. And indeed, the magelet is adept at using claws. However, perhaps the most important trait of gishlets is that they have the same MACC as their non-odd counterparts! This allows magelets to make use of essentially all of their skills.</p><p>Although magelets may deal less damage than their non-odd counterparts when spellcasting, magelets excel at avoidability, DPS with claws, and WACC (useful for last-hitting when training with Poison Mist). They also have some unique equipment choices, as there are several TMA-oriented weapons which have significant LUK requirements, but no significant INT requirements.</p><p>Magelets can thrive in any of the main three mage paths (fire/poison, ice/lightning, cleric/priest/bishop). F/P magelets benefit from the fact that poison effects (from Poison Breath or Poison Mist) ignore the mage‚Äôs TMA. I/L magelets benefit from the strong crowd control and raw DPS of I/L skills. And, last but not least, clerics/priests/bishops benefit from the fact that Heal damage scales with LUK, as well as from the awesome utility skills provided by bishops.</p><a href="#subspecies" class="h-anchor"><h4 id="subspecies">Subspecies</h4></a><a href="#introduction-to-odd-jobs" class="go-back"

By adding some AP into LUK and/or INT, but otherwise adding AP like a STR/DEX mage, the gish is capable of harnessing both worlds: physical <em>and</em> magical. The gish is in a unique position to make good use of special items that have both physical and magical benefits, like the umbrellas, the Crimson Arcglaive, the Flamekeeper Cordon, the Kebob, the Flaming Katana, etc.</p><p>Gishes must sacrifice some of the melee power of the STR/DEX mage in order to be proficient with magical attacks. Also, gishes are extremely unique in their reliance on every single stat: STR, DEX, INT, <em>and</em> LUK! These two facts combine to make the gish perhaps the single most difficult job in MapleStory to play properly. Allocating AP and choosing gear for a gish is <strong>not</strong> for the faint of heart, and MACC issues (and some WACC issues) abound.</p><p>However, for those willing to take on the challenge, gishes can be incredibly rewarding. Not only are they mixed attackers, but they are capable of alternating between modes of combat without switching equipment.
