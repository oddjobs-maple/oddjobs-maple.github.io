set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door post, and

Sindits <em>can</em> parallel the woodsman’s ability to do both ranged &amp; melee physical DPS, but where the sindit is a mainstream build designed merely to overcome the awkward early power curve of dagger-wielding rogues, the woodsman represents a genuine dedication to the classical martial arts. With that dedication comes a totally different skillset and array of playstyles that makes the woodsman both unique, and redoubtable in the eyes of mortals.</p><ul><li><a href="#a-quick-note-on-the-name">A quick note on the name</a></li><li><a href="#pros-and-cons">Pros and cons</a></li><li><a href="#ap-build">AP build</a></li><li><a href="#skill-builds">Skill builds</a><ul><li><a href="#archer-archery-specialisation">Archer (archery specialisation)</a></li><li><a href="#archer-melee-specialisation">Archer (melee specialisation)</a></li><li><a href="#hunter-archery-specialisation">Hunter (archery specialisation)</a></li><li><a href="#hunter-melee-specialisation">Hunter (melee specialisation)</a></li><li><a href="#crossbowman-archery-specialisation">Crossbowman (archery specialisation)</a></li><li><a href="#crossbowman-melee-specialisation">Crossbowman (melee specialisation)</a></li><li><a href="#ranger">Ranger</a></li><li><a href="#sniper">Sniper</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#itemization">Itemization</a><ul><li><a href="#equipment">Equipment</a><ul><li><a href="#armaments">Armaments</a><ul><li><a href="#archery">Archery</a></li><li><a href="#melee">Melee</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#shields">Shields</a></li><li><a href="#headgear">Headgear</a></li><li><a href="#clothing">Clothing</a></li><li><a href="#footwear">Footwear</a></li><li><a href="#gloves">Gloves</a></li><li><a href="#capes">Capes</a></li><li><a href="#earrings">Earrings</a></li><li><a href="#eyewear">Eyewear</a></li><li><a href="#facewear">Facewear</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#other-items">Other items</a><ul><li><a href="#potions-food-drinks">Potions/food/drinks</a></li><li><a href="#ammunition">Ammunition</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#a-quick-note-on-the-name" class="h-anchor"><h2 id="a-quick-note-on-the-name">A quick note on the name</h2></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

Rather than attempting to fix the English language and write a MapleStory guide in one fell swoop, “woodsman” and “woodsmen” are here used as gender-neutral, catch-all terms.</p><a href="#pros-and-cons" class="h-anchor"><h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and cons</h2></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

Contrast this with gishes, who may not be able to do <em>physical</em> ranged damage, but can nevertheless cast ranged spells and do physical melee combat, both without switching weapons at all.</li><li>Considerably worse accuracy in comparison to an ordinary archer, due to having a base DEX of exactly 25.</li><li>Unfortunately not as good at ranged combat, nor at melee combat, as some other jobs are (particularly non-odd jobs, i.e. ordinary/mainstream jobs). Given the same equipment, any ordinary archer build (STRless or otherwise) will be able to outperform you at range (although you will outperform them at melee, of course) easily. Any warrior, bandit, or brawler build that could be considered “standard” or “mainstream” in any way will be able to outperform you in melee from at least second job onwards, and likely earlier as well (although you will outperform them at range, of course).</li></ul><a href="#ap-build" class="h-anchor"><h2 id="ap-build">AP build</h2></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

However, only one such AP build actually makes sense, and that is leaving your base DEX, INT, and LUK at 25, 4, and 4, respectively, and putting all other APs into STR.</p><a href="#skill-builds" class="h-anchor"><h2 id="skill-builds">Skill builds</h2></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

Not only are these obviously not the only two viable skill builds, but their names are also perhaps misleading. The “melee specialist” is perfectly adept at archery from second job onwards (and is good enough to be useful in first job), and the “archery specialist” is perfectly adept at melee, even if they can suffer from more accuracy issues during early second job (albeit not quite as many issues as many other melee jobs).</p><p>By the time that you’ve hit level 70 as a woodsman, the distinction between woodsmen who have chosen to prioritise melee early on, and woodsmen who have chosen to prioritise archery early on, collapses. Therefore, for third and fourth job skill builds, no distinction is made between “melee specialisation” and “archery specialisation”.</p><a href="#archer-archery-specialisation" class="h-anchor"><h3 id="archer-archery-specialisation">Archer (archery specialisation)</h3></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

<p>This first-job SP allocation strategy is essentially identical to your typical archer’s. The only thing that might surprise some people is that we leave Focus at level 0. Why leave Focus at 0 and spend those SPs on The Blessing of Amazon, when you could spend them on Focus and get both accuracy <em>and</em> avoidability? The simple answer is that buffs of the same kind (e.g. two different accuracy buffs) do <strong>not</strong> stack. This effectively means that Focus is useless at levels below 11, and situationally, it may even be useless at max level; Sniper Pills (available from any of 3 different NPCs in Ludibrium for roughly 500 mesos a pop) already give a +10 accuracy buff, and there are other consumables that give even more powerful accuracy buffs (including, but not limited to, Maple Pops, which drop from two distinct species of low-level monsters and grant a +100 accuracy buff). Plus, having a Cleric in your party typically negates the usefulness (due to Bless), and the avoidability component is already obsoleted by the Archer Elixir (available from an NPC in New Leaf City for 5k mesos a pop), which grants a +20 avoidability buff. The Blessing of Amazon, on the other hand, is a <em>passive</em> skill, and thus stacks with everything.</p><a href="#archer-melee-specialisation" class="h-anchor"><h3 id="archer-melee-specialisation">Archer (melee specialisation)</h3></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

<p>This build starts out with one point into Arrow Blow, because that single SP is enough to grant you a ranged single-target DPS skill that is significantly superior to simply basic-attacking with your (cross)bow. You can, if you want, forgo Arrow Blow entirely in favor of getting Focus up to level 17 (instead of level 16) by the time that you’re level 21; however, I expect that for most people, a single SP is worth it here. Because we are focusing on melee combat (for <em>at least</em> first job), we don’t have to frontload any archery-specific skills, and can also safely leave Double Shot at level 0 without sacrificing performance of our main second-job attack, Arrow Bomb/Iron Arrow. For this reason, we instead frontload accuracy boosts in order to allow ourselves to fight higher-level and higher-avoidability monsters at lower character levels. In order to not totally neglect archery (again, particularly because we will be getting Arrow Bomb/Iron Arrow at level 30), we do still need to max The Eye of Amazon, as well as Critical Shot. For this reason, we stop putting SPs into Focus once the skill is at level 16 (rather than at level 20, the maximum level of the skill). See the “Archer (archery specialisation)” skill build section for a justification on why we prioritise The Blessing of Amazon over Focus.</p><a href="#hunter-archery-specialisation" class="h-anchor"><h3 id="hunter-archery-specialisation">Hunter (archery specialisation)</h3></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

<p>We start with the basics here: one point into Arrow Bomb to be able to use it, and then max Bow Mastery for the damage, accuracy, and damage stability. Then we immediately dip into Bow Booster to get it to a one minute duration of extra fast shootin’. Then Arrow Bomb is maxed, to increase the damage and the stun proc chance of our main attacking skill.</p><p>At this point, all of the super essential stuff is out of the way, which means that we can get back to dumping SP into first-job skills in order to salvage as many precious and much-needed points of accuracy as possible. First is maxing The Blessing of Amazon, for reasons outlined in the “Archer (archery specialisation)” skill build section. Then we get a little greedy and go directly from level 0 Focus to maxed Focus; it’s OK to leave this for last or whatever, especially if you aren’t having any accuracy problems or your accuracy problems wouldn’t be ameliorated by Focus, but I’ve put it here because it doesn’t cause you to really put off any super important skills. If you expect to <em>always</em> have at least a +20 accuracy buff from other sources, then Focus isn’t much good, but we’re assuming that maxing Focus is at least resonably important, since it allows you to <em>guarantee</em> that you really do <em>always</em> have at least a +20 accuracy buff.</p><p>Then we max Power Knock-Back, made even more powerful by your stronk arms. Finally, the rest of the SPs go into Bow Booster and Soul Arrow, keeping the two as close as possible in terms of duration. Why put off Soul Arrow for so long (first acquired at level 64)? For two main reasons:</p><ol><li>The reality is that Soul Arrow is a convenience skill; that is, with just a bit of quiver management, the need for Soul Arrow is all but eliminated. Not using Soul Arrow is mostly an issue for inventory space.</li><li>While ordinary archers are constantly seeking more DEX and more WATK in order to boost their damage output ever higher, I would argue that woodsmen have this same need, but even more intensely. As a woodsman using an ordinary archer’s weapon, you are constantly fighting the fact that you are DEXless, and yet are wielding a weapon whose main damage stat is DEX. In your quest to ameliorate this problem as much as you can, one accessible source of WATK is that of the WATK bonuses granted by your ammunition.

<p>This skill build ends up being more similar to the “archery specialised” hunter, in comparison to the more stark difference between their first jobs. As a result, many of the justifications for these skill builds are more-or-less the same, so refer to the “Hunter (archery specialisation)” skill build for those.</p><p>One difference here is that the “melee specialised” hunter had a significantly different first-job skill build, which affects the exact course of the second-job skill build. Also, we prioritise Power Knock-Back over ranged single-target DPS, because the “melee specialised” hunter probably just wants to melee when the situation arises to be dealing single-target DPS. The “melee specialised” hunter (generally) pulls out their bow for one skill and one skill only: Arrow Bomb. Power Knock-Back helps to control mobs that get close enough to disallow Arrow Bomb from being used. Double Shot is neglected because by the time that you would ever get around to using it, you would already be level 70 and have level 1 Strafe.</p><a href="#crossbowman-archery-specialisation" class="h-anchor"><h3 id="crossbowman-archery-specialisation">Crossbowman (archery specialisation)</h3></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

<p>The first thing to note here is that now that we’ve finished second job, woodsman skill builds have pretty much lost any distinction from ordinary archer skill builds. From level 70 onwards, you can make use of the common wisdom surrounding rangers/snipers/bowmasters/marksmen when allocating your SPs. This particular skill build optimises for raw combat prowess and flexibility in training locations, so it makes a good place to start for woodsmen.</p><p>At level 70 we get a point into Strafe, since this is usually superior to maxed Double Shot (or, if you were “melee specialised”, this represents an enormous bump in your single-target archery DPS). Then we immediately get Arrow Rain to a level (21) that is useful and effective for training and general multi-target combat; note that level 5 of Mortal Blow is a requirement to put any SPs into Arrow Rain. From there we do something similar to Strafe, getting it to level 20. Then we come back to Arrow Rain to max it out and thus maximize effectiveness in multi-target combat. Then we get one point into Inferno and Silver Hawk. Inferno is not a very useful skill on its own, but it is useful for luring mobs that are far away from you when you want to use Arrow Rain on them (since Arrow Rain is centered on the woodsman as an AoE effect). Arrow Bomb could be used for this, except that Arrow Bomb stuns, and thus prevents the lured mobs from immediately coming towards you. Silver Hawk helps with single-target DPS, and can also stun mobs without you having to actually do anything. Then we get Puppet up to a useful level (7), to help when engaging in single-target combat. Now we can finally max Strafe and maximize single-target archery DPS. Then we max Silver Hawk to help maximize single-target DPS in general, and also make the stun more reliable. Then we max Puppet so that it sticks around for longer (more HP and longer duration). Mortal Blow is then maxed, which helps when engaging in archery and using attacks that aren’t Arrow Rain. This can still help later on, because Strafe remains useful as a single-target burst DPS skill, and Arrow Bomb remains your primary stunning ability (in addition to Silver Hawk). We then get Inferno to level 16, not for the damage, but because the range increases at level 16, which is what we care about, since we are using it to lure monsters from afar. Finally, we have nothing left to spend SPs on except Thrust, so we spend the rest on that.</p><p>There are a lot of things that you can tweak here, and you should definitely think about what you really want from your skill build, even adjusting it on the fly as you get comfortable using these skills. Because this example build is focused around raw combat prowess, Thrust is left as a last priority. However, the extra SPEED from Thrust is not only useful when engaging in archery, but also particularly when engaging in melee, as woodsmen are wont to do. It is therefore entirely reasonable to sacrifice some levels of Inferno and/or Mortal Blow in order to get higher levels of Thrust (e.g. leaving Inferno at level 1 and maxing Thrust); again, this example build is dedicated only to raw combat prowess, as a simple example. You can also prioritise Arrow Rain and Strafe differently, e.g. putting one point into Arrow Rain for convenience and then immediately maxing Strafe. This can be followed by a point in Silver Hawk, a handful of points into Puppet, maxing Silver Hawk, and then maxing Puppet; this maximises your single-target combat potential very early on.</p><p>Another possibility is a kind of radically melee-focused build. In reality, second job and onwards for archers — and particularly third job and onwards — are so oriented away from melee combat that you may as well think of skill builds as I have here; that is, as being essentially ordinary archer skill builds. But ranger does offer at least three skills that can be used without a bow in hand (in descending order of general importance):</p><ol><li>Silver Hawk</li><li>Puppet</li><li>Thrust</li></ol><p>It is possible to prioritise these skills above the other skills offered by ranger, and allow Arrow Bomb (and Arrow Blow or Double Shot) to suffice for longer. I just cannot really recommend such a build, as I believe it to be more useful to think of SPs as being dedicated to improving archery (and also melee to some extent), and APs as being dedicated to improving melee (and also archery to some extent).</p><a href="#sniper" class="h-anchor"><h3 id="sniper">Sniper</h3></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

Assuming that both bows cost you equally much (unlikely, given that the Maple Kandiva Bow is an event-specific weapon, and the Bow of Magical Destruction drops from an ordinary monster), and assuming that both bows are completely clean and have average stats, the Maple Kandiva Bow is somewhat superior: identical WATK, a faster speed (5 (“Fast”) vs. the Bow of Magical Destruction’s 6 (“Normal”)), a slightly better knockback rate (48% &gt; 47%), and a nifty +100 MaxHP.

<p>[1]: The earliest attestation of this weapon that I can find is from 2007-05-04 at the latest (actually predating the 2008 GMS Three Year Anniversary Event (2008-05-07 – 2008-06-10) by almost exactly a year), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070504024305/http://mapletip.com/maplestory-equipment/bow+of+magical+destruction/1452018/">due to MapleTip</a>. However, it’s unclear at what point this weapon actually became <em>available</em> in the game, as it would (at some point) drop from the ordinary level 64 monster, Leader B (exclusive to Zipangu) — yet, MapleTip lacks this knowledge, and so it is possible that the weapon’s info was available in the <code>*.wz</code> files only, before the weapon properly existed in the game. The earliest attestation (that I could find with a quick search) of the Bow of Magical Destruction actually existing in the game is from 2011-01-07, exactly one month <em>after</em> Big Bang. Notably, however, MapleLegends (v62), MapleRoyals (v62–83), and MapleSaga (v62) all have this bow.</p></details>

As such, this section will mostly just highlight the <em>differences</em> w.r.t. melee armaments for woodsmen, as compared to melee armaments for permabeginners.</p><p>Woodsmen obviously do not have access to any permabeginner-specific armaments; this means no access to any of the following:</p><ul><li>The level 20 Frozen Tuna</li><li>Sake Bottle</li><li>Maroon Mop</li></ul><p>Woodsmen do, however, have access to a small handful of armaments that permabeginners do not have access to, although they are unfortunately limited to low levels:</p><ul><li>Wooden Sword (level 10)</li><li>Metal Axe (level 10)</li><li>Wooden Mallet (level 10)</li><li>Monkey Wrench (level 25)</li></ul><p>The Monkey Wrench is of particular note due to being the highest level of these four, although its expected DPS (assuming zero DEX and assuming that the monster has zero WDEF) is roughly 98.88% that of a Fish Spear; however, the expected damage per hit is roughly 114.7% that of the Fish Spear under the same conditions. This advantage for the Monkey Wrench is, of course, amplified by higher monster WDEF.</p><a href="#shields" class="h-anchor"><h4 id="shields">Shields</h4></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

                                ><p>An archer? Wearing a shield? Blasphemy! But with woodsmen, anything is possible. When engaging in melee and using a one-handed weapon, you will, of course, want a shield. As usual, the Maple Shield is the most powerful, simply because it has three extra slots, and you’ll be wanting to scroll for WATK (and/or STR). More accessible are the Stolen Fence (available from an NPC and as a monster drop) and the Pan Lid (available as a reasonably common monster drop). The Palette sports better defense than the Stolen Fence or Pan Lid, and the LUK that it grants is useful for the accuracy (and avoidability). My preference is the Stone Shield, if the implementation even has it, due to its superior defense. The Black Phoenix Shield (again, if the implementation even has it) is superior to either the Stolen Fence or the Pan Lid, and has twice as much MDEF (and WDEF) as the Maple Shield.</p><a href="#headgear" class="h-anchor"><h4 id="headgear">Headgear</h4></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

These headgears are so incredibly powerful that they need no introduction. Zakum Helmets are generally more accessible, as Zakum tends to be run fairly often in most implementations, and only requires level 50 (instead of the level 80 of Scar/Tar hats). Scar/Tar hats aren’t really better than Zakum Helmets, although it depends on what you want to optimize for; obviously, the ideal Scar/Tar hat for a woodsman is generally a Scarlion Hat (DEX).</p><p>When it comes to scrolling headgear, obviously you ideally want to scroll for DEX, but scrolling for ACC is similarly good, and even 10%/30% DEF scrolls can give a +1 ACC, which could be nice. Scrolling for HP is also viable for obvious reasons. All-stat hats can be effectively Chaos Scrolled, if you’re feeling really saucy, or somehow have a large supply of Chaos Scrolls.</p><a href="#clothing" class="h-anchor"><h4 id="clothing">Clothing</h4></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

For WATK buffs that are available from NPCs (“WATK⋅s/meso” is the magnitude of the WATK buff given, multiplied by the duration, divided by the price per unit, and “meso/s” is the cost of one second of the buff):</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col" class="align-left">name</td><th scope="col" class="align-right">WATK</td><th scope="col" class="align-right">WATK⋅s/meso</td><th scope="col" class="align-right">meso/s</td><th scope="col" class="align-right">duration</td><th scope="col" class="align-right">meso/unit</td><th scope="col" class="align-left">available from</td><th scope="col" class="align-left">notes</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="align-left">Mapleade</td><td class="align-right">2</td><td class="align-right">0.024</td><td class="align-right">83.333</td><td class="align-right">30:00</td><td class="align-right">150,000</td><td class="align-left">NLC</td><td class="align-left">Not actually a good idea, of course, but just here for completeness.</td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Cherry Pie</td><td class="align-right">2</td><td class="align-right">0.320</td><td class="align-right">6.250</td><td class="align-right">8:00</td><td class="align-right">3,000</td><td class="align-left">NLC</td><td class="align-left">Not actually a good idea, of course, but just here for completeness.</td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Warrior Potion</td><td class="align-right">5</td><td class="align-right">1.800</td><td class="align-right">2.777</td><td class="align-right">3:00</td><td class="align-right">500</td><td class="align-left">Henesys, Kerning City, Ellinia, Perion, Lith Harbor, Nautilus, Orbis, El Nath, Aquarium, Mu Lung, KFT, Herb Town, Omega Sector, Leafre, Ariant, Magatia, Singapore, Malaysia, Ellin Forest, Mushroom Castle</td><td class="align-left"></td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Warrior Pill</td><td class="align-right">5</td><td class="align-right">6.000</td><td class="align-right">0.833</td><td class="align-right">10:00</td><td class="align-right">500</td><td class="align-left">Ludibrium</td><td class="align-left"></td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Chili Crab</td><td class="align-right">8</td><td class="align-right">0.706</td><td class="align-right">11.333</td><td class="align-right">10:00</td><td class="align-right">6,800</td><td class="align-left">Singapore, Malaysia</td><td class="align-left"></td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Pepper Crab</td><td class="align-right">8</td><td class="align-right">0.750</td><td class="align-right">10.667</td><td class="align-right">5:00</td><td class="align-right">3,200</td><td class="align-left">Singapore, Malaysia</td><td class="align-left"></td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Takoyaki (Jumbo)</td><td class="align-right">8</td><td class="align-right">1.143</td><td class="align-right">7.000</td><td class="align-right">10:00</td><td class="align-right">4,200</td><td class="align-left">Mushroom Shrine</td><td class="align-left"></td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Takoyaki (Octopus Ball)</td><td class="align-right">8</td><td class="align-right">1.200</td><td class="align-right">6.667</td><td class="align-right">5:00</td><td class="align-right">2,000</td><td class="align-left">Mushroom Shrine</td><td class="align-left"></td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Kangkung Belacan</td><td class="align-right">8</td><td class="align-right">1.263</td><td class="align-right">6.333</td><td class="align-right">10:00</td><td class="align-right">3,800</td><td class="align-left">Malaysia</td><td class="align-left"></td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Warrior Elixir</td><td class="align-right">12</td><td class="align-right">1.152</td><td class="align-right">10.417</td><td class="align-right">8:00</td><td class="align-right">5,000</td><td class="align-left">NLC</td><td class="align-left"></td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Cider</td><td class="align-right">20</td><td class="align-right">6.000</td><td class="align-right">3.333</td><td class="align-right">5:00</td><td class="align-right">1,000</td><td class="align-left">Showa, Dead Man’s Gorge</td><td class="align-left">Gives a −5 ACC debuff for its duration, but this is easily cancelled out by any other ACC buff (e.g. Focus, or Sniper Pills).

The two stand-out items here are the Warrior Pill and the Cider. Both are tied for first place w.r.t. WATK⋅s/meso, with the Warrior Pill being the low-cost but low-WATK alternative to the higher-cost but higher-WATK Cider. This makes Ciders great for doing big damage without breaking the bank or running into scarcity (as you might with items that give WATK buffs greater than +20), and Warrior Pills great for a WATK buff that you can have on at all times for a very low meso cost (just 0.833 meso/s!).</p><p>Ciders, however, are burdened by only stacking up to 5 per inventory slot (they are not burdened by the −5 ACC debuff, since hat is easily cancelled out); as a result, if you want the highest store-bought WATK buff possible, <em>and</em> you haven’t the inventory space for Ciders, Warrior Elixirs are your best bet. Other entries here are either not useful, or are situationally useful when you happen to be near an NPC that sells them.</p><p>Also of note are accuracy potions/food/drinks. For woodsmen that are doing more of the “melee specialised” kind of build (see above), these are not really of much concern, since you get access to useful levels of the Focus skill relatively early on. For other woodsmen, I recommend the use of Sniper Pills (+10 ACC for 10 minutes, available for 500 mesos a pop in Ludibrium) until you get Focus to at least level 10. Of course, you only have to use these on an as-needed basis.</p><a href="#ammunition" class="h-anchor"><h4 id="ammunition">Ammunition</h4></a><a href="#the-martial-classicist-the-strongest-drawing-arm-in-all-the-land-the-woodsman" class="go-back"

                                ><p>Like potions/food/drinks that give WATK buffs, ammunitions that give WATK buffs are a useful way to eke out a few extra WATK, whenever you are engaging in archery. Particularly, the cheapest kind are bronzed ammunition, which grant +1 WATK and can be purchased from various NPCs (in the Aquarium, Ludibrium, KFT, Leafre, and the Omega Sector) for 10 mesos per unit (20k mesos for a ream of 2k units). More beneficial are colored ammunition (red for arrows, blue for quarrels), which grant a whopping +4 WATK, and can be purchased in Showa Town for 40 mesos per unit (80k mesos for a ream of 2k units); diamond ammunition grants the same bonus for half the price, although diamond ammunition can only be purchased by those that are allies of the Raven Ninja Clan.</p><p>Note that although we are using two thousand as a “ream” here — because that is the size of a stack of normal arrows — bronzed ammunition stacks up to 1.8k per slot, and colored ammunition up to 1k. Also note that when Soul Arrow is active, you cannot benefit from any special ammunition.</p>
