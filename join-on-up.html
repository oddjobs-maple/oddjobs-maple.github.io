            Oddjobs has a guild (also called <b>Oddjobs</b>) that is active on
            <a

              href="https://maplelegends.com/"
              >MapleLegends</a
            >. You can recognize us by the guild tags below our nametags:
          </p>

          <p>
            There are absolutely <strong>no</strong> level requirements for
            being a member of <b>Oddjobs</b>. All that we ask is that you
            always follow a few very simple rules, any time that you are
            playing a character that is (or aspires to be) a member of
            <b>Oddjobs</b>:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Be cool.</strong> Don&rsquo;t harsh anyone&rsquo;s vibes;
              that&rsquo;s not cool.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Be odd.</strong> Obviously, you gotta be playing an odd
              job.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Don&rsquo;t accept leech.</strong> Don&rsquo;t accept
              leech from anyone (yourself included), for any price (even zero).
              You&rsquo;re still allowed to <em>give</em> leech to others,
              although that&rsquo;s somewhat unlikely&hellip;
            </li>
            <li>
              Don&rsquo;t HP (and/or MP) wash so much that the
              &ldquo;don&rsquo;t accept leech&rdquo; rule becomes an issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Have fun.</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <b>Oddjobs</b> is part of an alliance by the name of
            <b>Suboptimal</b>. At the moment, there are three other guilds in
            the alliance:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Flow</b>, a largely permabeginner guild that is the
              <i>de facto</i> off-island permabeginner guild of MapleLegends;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Victoria</b>, the guild for
              <a
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://codeberg.org/Victoria/resources/src/branch/master/rules.md"
                >Victoria-Island-locked (vicloc)</a
              >
              MapleLegends characters;
            </li>
            <li>
              and <b>Ossyrians</b>, the guild for
              <a
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://forum.maplelegends.com/index.php?threads/the-ossyria-lite-lock-the-vic-lock-3rd-job-dlc.46610/"
                >Ossyria-locked (ossloc)</a
              >
              MapleLegends characters.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <b>Suboptimal</b> is, however, open to bringing one more (as the
            maximum number of guilds in an alliance is five)
            gameplay-restriction-oriented guild into the alliance!
          </p>

          <p>
            If you would like to join Oddjobs, and/or your guild would like to
            join Suboptimal, please do contact <b>deer</b> in-game (in-game
            names: <b>cervid</b>, <b>capreolina</b>, <b>rusa</b>,

            Suboptimal is also part of a <em>meta-alliance</em>
            (&ldquo;<b>Subdream</b>&rdquo;, or
            &ldquo;<b>Dreamoptimal</b>&rdquo;) with another alliance called
            <b>Dream</b>, which currently consists of three guilds:
            <b>Nimbus</b>, <b>Chroma</b>, and <b>GangGang</b>. Unlike the
            guilds of Suboptimal, the guilds of Dream are not oriented around
            gameplay restrictions or anything of the sort, but rather are
            long-time allies of Suboptimal, with some crossover existing
            between the two alliances. You can find our meta-alliance
            headquarters in-game at <strong>FM 4-2</strong> (channel 4, FM room
            2)!

              >JoblessMS</a
            >
            is a MapleStory server that is dedicated almost exclusively to odd
            jobs. Being based on version 62 of GMS, and having low rates, the
            overall framework of JoblessMS will be familiar to many. But
            JoblessMS is unique in its commitment to odd jobs, hence its name.
            The only way to play anything that <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> an odd job
            is to make an &ldquo;ironman&rdquo; (or &ldquo;iron mode&rdquo;)
            character, which cannot be a member of parties, cannot trade with
            others, cannot drop items, &amp;c., so that they are totally
            isolated from the rest of the playerbase. JoblessMS also offers the
            option to play permadeath, on a character-by-character basis.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although JoblessMS has plenty of downsides in comparison to a more
            mature server like MapleLegends (particularly, the population size,
            of course), we recommend giving it a shot if possible. JoblessMS is
            the server that was responsible for the formation of Oddjobs.
