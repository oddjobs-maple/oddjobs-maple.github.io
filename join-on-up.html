            There are absolutely <strong>no</strong> level requirements for
            being a member of <b>Oddjobs</b>. All that we ask is that you always
            follow a few very simple rules, any time that you are playing a
            character that is (or aspires to be) a member of <b>Oddjobs</b>:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Be cool.</strong> Don&rsquo;t harsh anyone&rsquo;s vibes;
              that&rsquo;s not cool.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Be odd.</strong> Obviously, you gotta be playing an odd
              job.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Don&rsquo;t leech.</strong> Don&rsquo;t accept leech from
              anyone, and don&rsquo;t leech others. Just play the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Don&rsquo;t wash.</strong> HP (and MP) washing is
              disallowed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Have fun.</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>JoblessMS</h2>

          <p>
            <a
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href="https://joblessms.com/"
              >JoblessMS</a
            >
            is a MapleStory server that is dedicated almost exclusively to odd
            jobs. Being based on version 62 of GMS, and having low rates, the
            overall framework of JoblessMS will be familiar to many. But
            JoblessMS is unique in its commitment to odd jobs, hence its name.
            The only way to play anything that <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> an odd job
            is to make an &ldquo;ironman&rdquo; (or &ldquo;iron mode&rdquo;)
            character, which cannot be a member of parties, cannot trade with
            others, cannot drop items, &amp;c., so that they are totally
            isolated from the rest of the playerbase. JoblessMS also offers the
            option to play permadeath, on a character-by-character basis.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although JoblessMS has plenty of downsides in comparison to a more
            mature server like MapleLegends (particularly, the population size,
            of course), we recommend giving it a shot if possible. JoblessMS is
            the server that was responsible for the formation of Oddjobs.
