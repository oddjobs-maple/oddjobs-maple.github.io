          <p>
            We assume that the player can attack as quickly as possible (i.e.
            holding down the attack button), and does so uninterrupted: they
            are never struck, never have to move, never use potions, &amp;c.,
            and also never miss. We also assume that they are damaging exactly
            one foe at all times, and that that one foe has infinite HP. You
            can select a number of targets greater than one, but note that this
            does <strong>not</strong> take into account the damage taken by any
            of said virtual enemies, except for one of them. The ability to
            select a number of targets is only there for skills like Heal,
            which change their per-line damage based on the total number of
            targets.
          </p>

          <p>We assume that there is no particular damage cap.</p>

          <a href="#you-should-know" class="h-anchor"

            <p>
              Weapon speeds are calculated based on the speed of the weapon
              itself, in addition to any booster effects that may be active.
              The slowest possible speed is 9,<sup>[1]</sup> and the fastest is
              2. Booster skills add &minus;2 to your speed value, and so does
              Speed Infusion.<sup>[2]</sup> Booster skills and Speed Infusion
              do stack, granting &minus;4 speed (in addition to the speed of
              your weapon) when both are active.<sup>[2]</sup> However, your
              speed can never go below 2, so e.g. a weapon with speed 3 that is
              affected by a Booster skill is speed 2, <strong>not</strong> 1.
              You may need to use an external reference and/or look in the game
              files to find out the speed of any given weapon, because only
              some weapons have their true speeds displayed in-game. Others
              have ambiguous speed descriptions like &ldquo;Fast&rdquo;, which
              could correspond to a speed of 4, or to a speed of 5.
            </p>

            <p>
              Stats (STR, DEX, INT, LUK) are total stat values, after base
              stats <strong>and</strong> equipment <strong>and</strong> buffs.
              Likewise, total WATK is the sum of all WATK from your equipment
              (including both your weapon, and your other equips), plus WATK
              from skills, plus WATK from buffs (except Echo of Hero, which,
              for convenience, can be entered separately). Total MATK is
              defined similarly to total WATK, but it should be noted that it
              should also include the MATK that is due to your total INT score.
              This &ldquo;total MATK&rdquo; is displayed in-game as
              &ldquo;MAGIC&rdquo; inside of the &ldquo;DETAIL&rdquo; tab of the
              &ldquo;CHARACTER STATS&rdquo; window (in the keybinding GUI, this
              window is listed as &ldquo;ABILITY&rdquo;).
            </p>

            <p>
              The mastery is given here as a percentage. Your mastery can never
              be less than 10%, but it can be higher, if you have one or more
              relevant mastery skills (&ldquo;relevant&rdquo; because mastery
              skills typically only apply to certain classes of weapons, e.g.
              only axes). Most mastery skills increase your mastery up to a
              total of 60%, but some fourth-job skills can take you up to as
              high as 90%. Mastery for magical attacks works on a per-spell
              basis (based on which spell it is and what level it&rsquo;s at),
              and should be listed in-game within the spell&rsquo;s
              description.
            </p>

            <p>
              The &ldquo;Damage multi&rdquo; field under &ldquo;Skill&rdquo;
              refers to the damage percentage listed in the description of a
              physical attack; for example, the Power Strike skill has a
              &ldquo;Damage multi&rdquo; of 260% at max level. The &ldquo;Basic
              attack&rdquo; only applies to magical attacks and summons, and is
              generally listed in the skill description as &ldquo;basic
              attack&rdquo;; for example, the Magic Claw skill has a
              &ldquo;Basic attack&rdquo; of 40 at max level.
              &ldquo;Lines&rdquo; refers to how many lines of damage the
              attacking skill does; for example, this value is 1 for Power
              Strike and 2 for Magic Claw.
            </p>

            <p>
              Damage multipliers from skills, critical hits, and elemental
              effects work in tandem. All of these influences combine into a
              single multiplier that we will here refer to as &ldquo;<strong
                >the</strong
              >
              damage multiplier&rdquo;. This is the number by which you
              multiply your basic attack damage (for physical attacks, this is
              your basic attack &mdash; i.e. not using a skill &mdash; with no
              crits nor elemental effects nor reduction due to WDEF). These
              sources of damage multiplier (skills, crits, elemental effects)
              are <strong>additive</strong> in the sense that these multipliers
              are summed together, and then that sum makes up
              <em>the</em> damage multiplier.
              <strong
                >Note that basic attacks have a &ldquo;skill&rdquo; multiplier
                of 1</strong
              >, i.e. as if you were using an attacking skill that said
              &ldquo;100% damage&rdquo; in the description. For example, say
              you use the Arrow Blow skill as an archer who has maxed both
              Arrow Blow (described in-game as &ldquo;Damage 260%&rdquo;) and
              Critical Shot (described in-game as &ldquo;40% success rate,
              critical damage 200%&rdquo;, although the critical damage is
              actually 100 percentage points lower than described, i.e. 100%;
              see below). Let&rsquo;s assume that this particular use of Arrow
              Blow is a crit, and thus we get the benefit of the
              &ldquo;critical damage 200%&rdquo; (again, really 100%; see
              below). The damage multiplier is the sum of the multipliers from
              Arrow Blow and Critical Shot: 2.6&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.6.
              Thus, we expect this attack to (again, assuming the monster has 0
              WDEF) do 3.6 times as much as a non-critical basic attack would.
              Note that magic attacks work somewhat differently, and (as far as
              I know) do not use this additive notion of &ldquo;damage
              multiplier&rdquo;.
            </p>

            <p>
              The descriptions of skills that have to do with critical hits are
              typically misleading. Below is a list of these skills and what
              they <em>actually</em> add to the damage multiplier:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Critical Shot: 100 percentage points lower than described
                in-game; at max level, the description reads
                &ldquo;200%&rdquo;, but it only adds 100 percentage points to
                your damage multiplier.
              </li>
              <li>Critical Throw: Same as for Critical Shot.</li>
              <li>
                Stun Mastery: The in-game description is mostly correct (60
                extra percentage points added to the damage multiplier when
                Stun Mastery is at its maximum level), but this skill interacts
                bizarrely with Sharp Eyes: when the marauder/buccaneer is
                affected by Sharp Eyes, Stun Mastery acts as if it granted 100
                more percentage points than it nominally does, viz. 160 at max
                level. This extra 100 percentage points is
                <strong
                  >in addition to all of the percentage points contributed by
                  Sharp Eyes</strong
                >, which is 140 such points when Sharp Eyes is at its maximum
                level (see below).
              </li>
              <li>
                Sharp Eyes: 100 percentage points higher than described
                in-game; at max level, the description reads
                &ldquo;+40%&rdquo;, but it actually adds 140 percentage points
                to your damage multiplier. This also, for unknown reasons,
                interacts strangely with Stun Mastery (see above). Sharp Eyes
                in particular is a source of confusion (especially because it
                can be applied to characters of any class/job), so the
                paragraph immediately below is dedicated to it.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The in-game description of the Sharp Eyes skill is somewhat
              misleading. At max level, the skill grants &ldquo;[Critical]
              Damage + 40%&rdquo;. However, this should probably read
              &ldquo;+140%&rdquo;, because the actual value that is added to
              the damage multiplier is 1.4 (140 percentage points). For archers
              and assassins/hermits/nightlords, interpreting Sharp Eyes is
              pretty straightforward: it just adds something to your
              already-existing critical chance and to your already-existing
              critical multiplier. For example, an archer with maxed Critical
              Shot and maxed Sharp Eyes has a
              0.4&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.15&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.55 probability of critting,
              and a critical multiplier of 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.4&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.4.
              For marauders/buccaneers with Stun Mastery, Sharp Eyes works
              confusingly: it effectively adds 2.4 (instead of 1.4) to the
              critical multiplier of critical hits on stunned monsters. Stun
              Mastery&rsquo;s critical multiplier at max level is 0.6, so with
              maxed Sharp Eyes, it is increased to 0.6 + 2.4 = 3.0. For
              physical attackers who do
              <em>not</em> already have a critical-hit-granting skill, being
              buffed with maxed Sharp Eyes means an overall
              0&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.15&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.15 probability of critting, and
              a critical multiplier of 1.4; <strong>not</strong> a critical
              multiplier of 0.4. Note that the value referred to here as the
              &ldquo;critical multiplier&rdquo; is
              <strong>additive</strong> and <em>only</em> serves to cumulate
              into the overall &ldquo;damage multiplier&rdquo;. For more on
              this, see above. For magical attacks, the probability of critting
              with maxed Sharp Eyes is also 0.15, but an attack that crits does
              <strong>not</strong> add 1.4 to the damage multiplier of a
              non-crit, as you would expect (magical attacks do not use the
              same notion of &ldquo;damage multiplier&rdquo;). Instead, it
              simply multiplies the overall damage of the magical attack by a
              factor of 1.4. Nevertheless, if you want to use the calculator
              for magical attacks combined with Sharp Eyes, you should set the
              values in the inputs below as if you were setting them for a
              physical attacker who has no critical-hit-granting skill of their
              own.
            </p>

            <p>
              &ldquo;Good anim probability&rdquo; refers to the probability of
              your melee attack having a &ldquo;good&rdquo; (read: higher
              primary stat multiplier) animation, given that you&rsquo;re basic
              attacking or using a skill that animates similarly (e.g. Power
              Strike). This value is ignored whenever you&rsquo;re attacking
              with a skill that always uses a certain animation, e.g.
              Somersault Kick, which always stabs (i.e. never swings). This
              value is also ignored whenever you&rsquo;re attacking with a
              weapon that does not distinguish between &ldquo;good&rdquo; and
              &ldquo;bad&rdquo; animations, e.g. swords and daggers. The only
              weapon types that distinguish between &ldquo;good&rdquo; and
              &ldquo;bad&rdquo; animations are:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Polearms: swings are good, stabs are bad. Good anim probability
                is suspected to be 60%.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spears: stabs are good, swings are bad. Good anim probability
                is suspected to be 40%.
              </li>
              <li>
                Axes: swings are good, stabs are bad. Good anim probability is
                unknown.
              </li>
              <li>
                Blunt weapons: swings are good, stabs are bad. Good anim
                probability is unknown.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wands: swings are good, stabs are bad. Good anim probability is
                suspected to be 100%.
              </li>
              <li>
                Staves: swings are good, stabs are bad. Good anim probability
                is suspected to be 100%.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              You can select a number of targets greater than one, but note
              that this does <strong>not</strong> take into account the damage
              taken by any of said virtual enemies, except for one of them. The
              ability to select a number of targets is only there for skills
              like Heal, which change their per-line damage based on the total
              number of targets. Note that when casting Heal (maximum of 6
              targets), the caster counts as a target, thus lowering the
              maximum number of possible enemy targets from 6 to 5. Also note
              that Heal, unlike most spells, uses the &ldquo;Damage
              multi&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;Basic attack&rdquo; (the
              damage multi is typically 300% at maximum level).

              &ldquo;Ordinal # of hit&rdquo; refers to the position/index of
              the particular damaging strike in question, within the ordering
              of all damaging strikes produced by the attack in question. For
              example, when using Iron Arrow, the first damaging strike (the
              one that damages the first monster struck by the arrow) has an
              ordinal # of 1, the next damaging strike an ordinal # of 2, and
              so on.

              The &ldquo;Attack with Dark Power&rdquo; in the description of
              the Panic skills is a probability of the target having Darkness
              (the status effect that lowers WACC) inflicted on them, and is
              unrelated to the damage that each skill deals. Both Panic and
              Coma lack attack periods, because they are combo finishers.

              Venom skills (Venomous Star and Venomous Stab) have their damage
              calculated for <strong>just the venom</strong> damage over time.
              Also note that these same skills make use of the &ldquo;Basic
              attack&rdquo; parameter, as noted in their skill descriptions.

              The damage of the Heaven&rsquo;s Hammer skill is calculated on
              the server side. As a result, its exact damage formula has
              remained somewhat elusive. Two versions are given here: the
              original XiuzSource version, and a &ldquo;corrected&rdquo;
              version that uses the attacker&rsquo;s mastery to determine the
              minimum damage. The original XiuzSource version determines the
              minimum damage by simply multiplying the maximum damage by 0.8.

              values themselves. We often talk about the so-called
              &ldquo;stability&rdquo; of damage, which is essentially a way of
              talking about the

                >dispersion</a
              >
              of the damage instances, and the standard deviation is one way of
              quantifying dispersion. However, care must be taken when
              comparing two separate standard deviations, because standard
              deviation is an
              <em>absolute</em> measure of dispersion. As a result, two
              characters who appear to have roughly the <em>same</em> damage
              stability, but the magnitude of whose damage outputs &mdash; say,
              damage per line, for example &mdash; are significantly different,
              will have damage-per-line distributions with significantly
              <em>different</em> standard deviations. This is because the
              standard deviation is expressed in the same dimensions as the
              values themselves, so it scales up linearly as the values of the
              distribution are scaled up. To help get a <em>relative</em> (and
              thus more comparable) measure of damage stability,

              If you see an asterisk (*) on the right-hand side of a damage
              value (particularly, the upper bound of a range), it means that
              that value is <em>exactly</em> an integer, before it is sampled
              from. Damage ranges are <em>virtually</em> intervals of real
              numbers (actually

                >floating point numbers</a

              operations, but the point is that when a particular bound is
              <em>exactly</em> an integer, it becomes unclear whether or not it
              can ever be sampled. This is perhaps a bigger deal than it
              usually would be, because the fractional parts of the samples are
              truncated, making a sample of e.g. 2.999 effectively much less
              (viz. 1 less, instead of 0.001 less) than a sample of 3. If you
              see an asterisked value, you can effectively just subtract 1 from
              it. The method here chosen to display these liminal values is
              largely for completeness.<sup>[3]</sup>

                [1]: This is technically untrue; speeds above 9 are in fact
                possible, but would require equipping a weapon with a speed
                above 9 (because there is no way to increase speed values with
                (de)buffs or similar). Such weapons conventionally do not
                exist, although see for example the

                MapleLegends as far as I know). As a result, attack period
                values for speeds above 9 are unknown &mdash; and they may just
                be the same as for speed 9.

                [2]: Depending on the implementation, this may or may not be
                exactly correct. In early versions of MapleStory that have
                pirates (e.g. GMS v62), the client did not have a separate buff
                opcode for Speed Infusion, so Speed Infusion has to be
                &ldquo;emulated&rdquo; by using an ordinary Booster buff with
                twice the magnitude of a normal Booster skill (4 instead of 2).
                The result is thus usually the same, but for jobs that lack a
                booster skill of their own, this can be a big boon (&minus;4 to
                the speed of their weapon when affected by Speed Infusion,
                instead of the expected &minus;2). Also worth noting here is
                that many implementations lack a separate opcode for Spell
                Booster, so Speed Infusion can effectively lower spellcasting
                speeds beyond the usual &minus;2 of maxed Spell Booster (all
                the way to &minus;4, potentially). This is another artifact/bug
                of early pirate implementations, and spellcasting speeds below
                &minus;2 are not handled by this calculator.
