              What&rsquo;s an &ldquo;odd job&rdquo;?

          <p>
            Simply put, playing a character that is of an &ldquo;odd job&rdquo;
            is a way of intentionally playing the game wrong. Odd jobs are
            builds that are distinct enough from ordinary builds/jobs that they
            are considered jobs <em>in their own right</em> (alongside those
            set out explicitly by the game, such as page, gunslinger, &amp;c.).
            However, because the game generally does not directly ask players
            to play these odd jobs, they are purely self-imposed, and often
            (but not always) parasitic on the &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; (like
            crusader, magician, hunter, and so on) set out by the game itself.
            For example, only knowing that a certain character is a cleric
            <em>does not tell you</em> whether they might be some kind of odd
            job, like STR cleric or LUK cleric, or whether they might be an
            ordinary non-odd INT-based cleric.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no limit <i>per se</i> to what odd jobs exist, other than
            your imagination. Nevertheless, we&rsquo;ve made an attempt to
            catalogue some of the odd jobs that have already been invented; for
            more information, see the
            <a href="./odd-jobs.html">Odd Jobs</a> page. For a gentler
            introduction, see &ldquo;<a

            Because it&rsquo;s fun. Plus, odd jobs give new ways of
            experiencing MapleStory! If you <em>also</em> happen to think that
