          <p>
            Oddjobs represents a handful of folks who enjoy playing so-called
            &ldquo;odd jobs&rdquo; in (pre-Big Bang, or pre-BB)

              >MapleStory</a
            >. Oddjobs is spread over two servers:

              >JoblessMS</a

            self-imposed ruleset, complete with a cute little
            <abbr title="&#x1f34f;">apple</abbr> icon next to the name. Thus,
            Oddjobs is a &ldquo;guild&rdquo; both in

          <h2>What&rsquo;s an &ldquo;odd job&rdquo;?</h2>

          <p>
            Simply put, playing a character that is of an &ldquo;odd job&rdquo;
            is a way of intentionally playing the game wrong. Odd jobs are
            builds that are distinct enough from ordinary builds/jobs that they
            are considered jobs <em>in their own right</em> (alongside those set
            out explicitly by the game, such as page, gunslinger, &amp;c.).
            However, because the game generally does not directly ask players to
            play these odd jobs, they are purely self-imposed, and often (but
            not always) parasitic on the &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; (like crusader,
            magician, hunter, and so on) set out by the game itself. For
            example, only knowing that a certain character is a cleric
            <em>does not tell you</em> whether they might be some kind of odd
            job, like STR cleric or LUK cleric, or whether they might be an
            ordinary non-odd INT-based cleric.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no limit <i>per se</i> to what odd jobs exist, other than
            your imagination. Nevertheless, we&rsquo;ve made an attempt to
            catalogue some of the odd jobs that have already been invented; for
            more information, see the
            <a
              href="https://codeberg.org/deer/oddjobs/src/branch/master/out/README.md"
              >Odd Jobs</a
            >
            page.
          </p>

          <h2>But, why?</h2>

          <p>
            Because it&rsquo;s fun. Plus, odd jobs give new ways of experiencing
            MapleStory! If you <em>also</em> happen to think that playing odd
            jobs is fun, we encourage you to
            <a href="./join-on-up.html">join us</a>!

          <h2>Sounds good.</h2>

            See the <a href="./join-on-up.html">Join On Up</a> page for more
            information. If you aren&rsquo;t already familiar with playing odd
            jobs and want some place to start, the
            <a href="https://codeberg.org/deer/oddjob_guides">Guides</a> page
            may be of some use as well.
